# Shapes

Write a program in Python which performs calculations relating to triangles.

The program should first enter into a main menu, giving the user a choice of entering the number "1" , "2", or "3" . Entering the characher "q" should exit the program.

If ther user enters "1" at the main menu: The program will calculate a missing internal angle, given two internal angles (in degrees). The user should be prompted for each internal angle via a separate prompt, ie: The user is prompted for angle 1, presses enter, and is then prompted for angle 2. The program then calculates the missing angle, and prints all three angles in a nice format. The program should then return to the main menu. 

If the user enters "2" at the main menu: The program will calculate the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angle triangle, given the length of the two other sides (in cm). The user should be prompted, and the calculation should be reported in a similar fashion to the first task. The program should then return to the main menu.

If the user enters "3" at the main menu: The program will calculate the area of a triangle, given the lengths of the three sides (in cm). The user should be prompted, and the calculation should be reported in a similar fashion to the other tasks. The program should then return to the main menu.

In your program you should:

Use sensible variable and function names which follow convention
Use sensible design techniques, in order to make your program readable and easy to maintain
Use sensible comments

You should not use any libraries, unless you are instructed to or they are deemed absolutely necessary

You can assume that all input will be of the correct data type
